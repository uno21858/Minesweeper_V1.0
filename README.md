First graphical game developed for my integrative project. Minesweeper-style game using Pygame.




# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is my first graphical project, developed as part of my integrative project for my Computer Technologies Engineering degree. This game is inspired by the classic "Minesweeper," where players must uncover all the empty cells on a grid without triggering a mine. The player uses numbers indicating the number of mines surrounding each cell to make strategic decisions and win the game.
Features

Graphics: Pygame
Game Mechanics: Use of numbers to indicate proximity to mines.
Interactive functionality: Players select cells through mouse clicks.
Developed from scratch: All code was written manually (little of Jipiti) as part of my learning journey into graphical programming.

Also it generates a file "Coordenadas.txt" where the mines can be placed by the randomness of the program.
